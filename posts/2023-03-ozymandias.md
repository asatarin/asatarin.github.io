```
Amidst a digital land of endless code,
Where programmers toil with tireless might,
A program stood, a masterpiece bestowed,
The product of a thousand sleepless nights.

Its features grand, its functions vast and bold,
Its codebase crafted with precision rare,
Its developers, a team of legends told,
Whose talents bright, whose skills beyond compare.

And on its screen these words did proudly stand,
"A software king, of lines and functions great,
Behold my works, ye Mighty, and understand,
The power of the code that I create."

But time, that fickle foe, did take its toll,
And changes came, and updates were made,
The code, once pristine, began to grow old,
And soon, its flaws and bugs began to fade.

And now, amidst the digital decay,
The software king, once mighty and renowned,
Lies broken, lost, its power cast away,
Its code, a remnant of the past, unbound.

Thus, let us heed this cautionary tale,
Of software's fleeting fame, its passing worth,
And strive to build, with care that will not fail,
A legacy that lasts beyond the earth.
```
