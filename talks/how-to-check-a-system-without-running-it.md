Presented in Moscow in December 2017 at [Heisenbug](https://2017.heisenbug-moscow.ru/talks/2017/msk/79fuksrzakwwqu4cmikw62/) conference. Video and slides are in Russian.

### Abstract
Every day the systems which we develop become more and more complicated. 
It seems there is nowhere to hide from the ubiquitous complexity. 
One of its aspects is configuration. On the one hand, configuration 
has a significant influence on stability and availability of a system. 
On the other hand, there is too little time set aside for checking its 
correctness. In this talk, we'll explain how we test configuration and
how far it was useful for our project.

This talk will be helpful for those who want to learn an easy way to 
increase system stability and availability in production.
