An interview I gave while promoting [Hydra conference](https://hydraconf.com/), on the topics of distributed systems, Hydra and other things (in Russian).

### References

These references came up during discussion and questions.


#### Books
 - ["Distributed systems for fun and profit"](http://book.mixu.net/distsys/single-page.html)
 
    This short book will give you a good grasp of some theoretical concepts without going too deep. 
    it's a good starting point to dive into distributed systems.
    
 - [“Database Internals: A Deep Dive into How Distributed Data Systems Work”](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492040347/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_x_GcI9Eb0T0NTMT)
   
    The first part is about single node databases and not directly about distributed systems. The second part is specifically about distributed systems. 
    One of the great things about this book is references — lots of good ones to go deep in any topic covered.
    
 - [“Designing Data-Intensive Applications”](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449373321/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_x_IcI9EbNF3SFHR)
 
    It's almost a classic book at this point. Martin Kleppmann does great job introducing the reader to fundamental concepts in distributed systems.
 

#### Amazon Aurora
Paper reviews on [Amazon Aurora database](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/), with links to papers themselves:
 - [Amazon Aurora: design considerations for high throughput cloud-native relational databases](https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/03/25/amazon-aurora-design-considerations-for-high-throughput-cloud-native-relational-databases/)
 - [Amazon Aurora: on avoiding distributed consensus for I/Os, commits, and membership changes](https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/03/27/amazon-aurora-on-avoiding-distributed-consensus-for-i-os-commits-and-membership-changes/)


#### Papers
 - [Distributed systems theory for the distributed systems engineer](https://www.the-paper-trail.org/post/2014-08-09-distributed-systems-theory-for-the-distributed-systems-engineer/)

    My deep dive into distributed systems started with this reading list. 
    It maintains a good balance between core theoretical concepts and practical system implementations. Highly recommended.

 - [Kinetics of Large Clusters](https://gridem.blogspot.com/2017/08/kinetics-of-large-clusters.html)
 
     A blog post from my former colleague on the probability of data loss in a cluster.
