## Wash your hands before you eat, or Sanitizers in testing

**Abstract**

As the saying goes, “with great power comes great responsibility”. 
C++ is a language with great expression power and vast capabilities. 
One have to pay for this capabilities with possible defects, 
which are absent in programs written in managed languages.

Sanitizers are wonderful tools, which will help you find complex 
defects in C++ programs. I’ll talk about these tools, 
what they can do, and how to use them in your project.
