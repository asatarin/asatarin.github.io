---

**Abstract**

Distributed systems meet us on a professional way more often and often. 
Modern popular sites and applications contain “under the hood” 
a distributed system — they challenge developers due to the fundamental 
complexity of their development, and a huge range of possible compromises in design. 
Andrey will talk about that part of challenges which are present in testing, 
about existing limitations and their impact on functionality. 
Issues will be covered:

1. How distributed systems are different from centralized systems?
1. What does it all mean for testing?
1. What properties and characteristics must be checked in distributed systems and how to do it?
1. Which approaches to testing of distributed systems are there and what problems do they solve?
1. What problems do remain unresolved?

The talk is built on an example of persistent distributed queue, which is being developed in Yandex. 
Attendees will learn how and what was tested by Andrey along Yandex team and what results were obtained.
